# EnconstaAi ðŸš—


## About ðŸ“„                   
This was a old project that i developed with my college friends for our software engineering class. The idea for the app came from a colleague that had difficulties finding places to park his car when he went to work in the morning. The system has a mobile component, for general users, but also a web component for owner's of private parkings.

 `` Here you will only find the mobile part of the project because it's the one i personally worked on.ðŸ˜Š``
  - You can find the web part of the project [here](https://github.com/leo2995/Encosta-ai)

 
## How it Works ðŸš€

 - The app requires the user to create a account. 
 - The user inputs the location they want to go to and the app shows them parking spots as well as the probability of the spots been vacant.
 - When users get to the location they wish to go, the app will ask the user if they see any other vacant parking spots.
 - The app colects data sent by the users in order to calculate the probabilities.
